## Features


### Server – Dragon
The Dragon server is built to provide full control and monitoring over connected clients. Its intuitive interface allows users to:
- **Monitor client status in real-time**  
- **Execute a wide range of commands** across multiple clients simultaneously  
- **Automate routine tasks** and workflows  
- **Visualize network activity and client connectivity**  
- **Handle high-volume operations efficiently**

Dragon is designed to be **modular and extensible**, allowing researchers and developers to add new features without restructuring the entire codebase. Its built-in dashboards provide a clean overview of connected clients and system activity.

### Client – Warrior
The Warrior client is lightweight and efficient. It is designed for **reliable connection management** and seamless integration with the server:
- **Automatic reconnection** if the client loses contact with the server  
- **Lightweight footprint**, optimized for minimal system impact  
- **Secure and reliable communication** over UDP  
- **Easy deployment** with self-contained configuration and dependencies  

The client emphasizes **stability, security, and controlled interaction**, making it ideal for testing networks, automation scripts, or managing authorized endpoints in educational and research environments.
